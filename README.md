# **README**
Hi, welcome to my GitHub. This time, I will showcase a sales data application for a store named **SMart**, also known as Sembako Mart. **SMart** is my first Capstone Project as part of my ongoing Data Science Bootcamp at Purwadhika. This application is built using Python as the programming language and implements CRUD functionalities.

**Note**
This application is created for educational purposes and for understanding basic programming concepts. You can use it as a reference or modify it according to your needs. Please note that this application may have limitations in terms of features and performance. Then, the application is executed and produces outputs in Bahasa.

## Now It's Time For Us To Delve Deeper Into This Application.
The **SMart** Grocery Store Application is a simple Python-based program that allows you to manage inventory and purchase transactions for grocery store items. With **SMart**, you can view the list of available items, add, delete, or modify item data, as well as efficiently perform purchase transactions.

### **Key Features**
1. Main Menu
2. View Grocery Items
3. Add Grocery Item
4. Delete Grocery Item
5. Modify Grocery Item
6. Purchase Grocery Item
7. Exit

#### **Main Menu**
In this Main Menu, the application will display an output similar to the first image, which contains the features available in this application. The Main Menu will appear every time we have completed the command for each feature.

#### **View Grocery Items**
You will be able to see the list of available grocery items along with their stock levels and unit prices. To give you an idea, you will be shown the items that are already present in the default list.

#### **Add Grocery Item**
In this menu, you can add new items to the store's list. You will be prompted to provide the item's details. For example, if you want to add 'Meat' to the store, you would input the item's information such as its name, unit, stock, and price. Once done, a new list will be displayed where the item you added will appear in that new list.

#### **Delete Grocery Item**
In this menu, you can remove items from the list. For example, if you want to remove 'Bayam' at number 4, you would input the number 4 to delete 'Bayam' from the list. After completing the process, you will immediately be shown a new list where 'Bayam' is no longer present in the list.

#### **Modify Grocery Item**
If you wish to modify the data of items in the list, then menu 4 is the right option for you to change the existing item data. In this menu, you will be asked to input the data you want to modify. For instance, you will be prompted to input the item number you want to change, the current item's name, the new item's name, the new unit, the new stock, and the new price after the modification.

#### **Purchase Grocery Item**
This is the final menu, which is used for purchasing items. First, you will be presented with a list of items available in the store. After reviewing the items, you can select the items you wish to buy. For example, if I want to purchase 'Beras' listed at number '1,' I would then select the quantity I want to buy. After inputting the desired items for purchase, a shopping cart will appear displaying the chosen items. Following this, you will be asked if you want to buy more items or not. If yes, you will be prompted to input additional items for purchase. Once you have finished selecting all the items you want to buy, a receipt will be generated showing the total amount due. You will then be asked to input the payment amount. If the payment is insufficient, you will be prompted to enter the correct amount. If your payment exceeds the total, the change will be calculated and returned to you.

#### **Additional Information**
After each purchase, the stock in the list will automatically decrease according to the quantity of items bought.

#### **Exit**
If you have finished using the SMart application and don't want to perform any more actions, you can exit the application by accessing this menu.
